# First Post

Hey there! This is my first post on this blog. I'm Alexy, and this is where I'll be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and whatever else comes to mind.

## What to Expect

I'm not entirely sure what I'll write about yet, but that's part of the fun. It might be:
- Random thoughts and observations
- Things I'm learning or working on
- Experiences worth sharing
- Whatever else feels interesting

## Why a Blog?

I wanted a place to write and share things without the pressure of social media. A blog feels more permanent, more thoughtful. Plus, I get to control the whole experience.

## The Name

"Scripted" - because life feels like we're all following some kind of script, but we can also write our own. Plus, it sounds cool.

*Here's to writing, thinking, and maybe entertaining a few people along the way.*
