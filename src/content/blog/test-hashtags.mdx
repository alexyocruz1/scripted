# Testing the Hashtag System

This is a test post to demonstrate how hashtags work on this blog. Hashtags can help with content discovery and SEO.

## How Hashtags Work

Hashtags on this blog serve several purposes:

1. **Content Discovery**: Help readers find related posts
2. **Internal Linking**: Can link to topic pages
3. **Social Sharing**: Work well when shared on social media
4. **SEO Benefits**: Include relevant keywords

## Auto-Generation

The post creation script can auto-generate hashtags based on:
- **Topic**: Movies, books, development, etc.
- **Tags**: Converted to hashtags
- **Content Analysis**: Based on keywords in the post

## Manual Control

You can also manually specify hashtags in the frontmatter:

```yaml
hashtags: ["#personal", "#thoughts", "#blog", "#writing"]
```

## Best Practices

- Keep hashtags relevant to the content
- Don't overuse them (max 8 recommended)
- Use consistent hashtags across related posts
- Include both broad and specific hashtags
